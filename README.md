# React + TypeScript + Vite

# test assignment for ADDAXCRM

Tried to do this within one day and with min libs as a challange for myself ( hours spend - 13.4)

Implemented functional

- basic calender (with UA holidays)
- ability to CRUD tasks (colored label for them) and move them around (DND)
- filter tasks by labels and text
- import/export calendar as JSON
- You also can downaload your calendar as photo

- to get back to current month press on the date title (it also save you data to localstorage)
- to crete/uppdate db click and enter
