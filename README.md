# React + TypeScript + Vite

Tried to do this within one day and with min libs as a challange for myself ( hours spend - 13.4)

Implemented functional

1 - basic calender (with UA holidays)
2 - ability to CRUD tasks (colored label for them) and move them around (DND)
3 - filter tasks by labels and text
4 - import/export calendar as JSON
5 - You also can downaload your calendar as photo
